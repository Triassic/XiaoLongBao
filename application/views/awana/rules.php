        <h2>Club Rules</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Rules are in place to promote a smooth flow for a club meeting while protecting the clubbers, staff, property and rights of others. 
            All our Church general rules and Sunday School rules also apply in our Awana club time.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Full participation by all clubbers is required. A clubber needs to plan to take part in the entire club night unless the clubber 
                brings a note from home or the clubber's parent contacts the Director.
            </li>

            <li>A clubber can only have four (4) unexcused absences. Sickness, family vacation and other circumstances outside of 
                clubber's control are considered excused absence.
            </li>

            <li>A clubber needs to come to attention whenever he/she hears a leader give a 5-count.</li>

            <li>Clubbers shall show respect for club leaders.</li>

            <li>No clubber is allowed on the game square once the flag ceremony has begun until its completion. 
                It is clubber's responsibility to be on time.</li>

            <li>Rough play or foul language will not be tolerated and is grounds to call parents to take clubber home.</li>

            <li>All clubbers must remain on church property during club hours.</li>

            <li>While awards may be earned while out of uniform, clubbers must be in uniform to receive them.</li>

            <li>Inappropriate behavior will result in the clubber being removed from the given activity and parents may 
                be called to pick up their child / children. Parents will be told of the problem and the clubber will be 
                welcomed back the following week if he/she is ready to comply with rules.</li>

            <li>Clubbers must wear closed-toed shoes (tennis shoes if possible) at game time. It is recommended
                that long pants be worn for the protection of their knees.</li>

            <li>Guests of a clubber or a visitor may attend 3 times before registration is required to attend again.</li>

            <li>No food or drinks is allowed outside of the Dining room.</li>

            <li>No running and chasing outside of the game square is allowed.</li>

            <li>No toys from home are allowed.</li>

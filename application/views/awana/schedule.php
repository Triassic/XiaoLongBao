            <h2>Club Schedule</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Each week the club meetings will begin at 7:00pm sharp. Check- in begins at 6:45pm (no earlier) in the locations listed below. 
                Parents, please stay with your child until he/she is checked in. Due to safety concerns we do not allow dropping off of 
                children for self-check-in.</p>

            <p><b>Check-in Locations:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cubbies : Room 29</li>
                    <li>Sparks  : Main Lobby at Reception</li>
                    <li>T-N-T   : Main Lobby at Reception</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>All clubs ends at 9:00pm sharp. Cubbies parents must sign out your children from the Cubbies classroom. Sparks and T-N-T 
                parents do not need to sign out your children, who usually have some light snacks after the closing ceremony at 9:00pm.
            </P>

            <p>Please note that the responsibility of the Awana leaders officially ends at 9:00pm, although some of them will stay longer 
                with the children. Please be considerate of our Awana leaders and their families, and pick up your children no later 
                than 9:15pm. For your children's safety and everyone's peace of mind, we will not allow children to exit the building 
                in order to meet you at your car.
            </p>
